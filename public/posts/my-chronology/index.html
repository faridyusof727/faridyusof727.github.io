    Chronology of How I Became a Software Engineer | Farid Yusof&#39;s Blog

I started becoming interested in computers when I was very young. Back then, I still remember using Windows 3.1. Although the main purpose was just to play Prince of Persia, I kept tinkering with other things too. Calculator, PaintBrush, and whatever I could explore.
As a kid, I really loved playing games. To the point where my parents would get angry because I was always gaming. At that time, my mother was still studying. She brought home books about computers, if I remember correctly, Borland C. I tried to implement the simple instructions from the book on the computer. By then, I was probably already using Windows 98." />

<p>I started becoming interested in computers when I was very young. Back then, I
still remember using Windows 3.1. Although the main purpose was just to play
Prince of Persia, I kept tinkering with other things too. Calculator,
PaintBrush, and whatever I could explore.</p>
<p>As a kid, I really loved playing games. To the point where my parents would get
angry because I was always gaming. At that time, my mother was still studying.
She brought home books about computers, if I remember correctly, Borland C.
I tried to implement the simple instructions from the book on the computer.
By then, I was probably already using Windows 98.</p>
<p>Besides learning basic things, I also experimented a lot with modifying
existing software, changing icons, changing software titles, and so on.</p>
<p>The dopamine rush kept hitting every time something I tried actually worked.
This was also the period when the internet was just starting to become popular.
Who doesn&rsquo;t remember the loud, screeching modem sound that took more than a
minute before you could finally open Yahoo Messenger?</p>
<p>Around this time, I started to understand FTP. I uploaded websites (HTML),
built my own site using Microsoft FrontPage, then upgraded to Macromedia
Dreamweaver. I uploaded everything to the server using FileZilla. At that
point, I didn&rsquo;t really know how to code websites yet, but later on, I
started learning Perl/CGI and then PHP. All of this was coded inside
Macromedia Dreamweaver.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years later, there was a period when the internet /
telephone line at home was cut off. If I remember correctly, I was in
matriculation at the time. Mobile phones were becoming popular, with
various Nokia models everywhere. Somehow, I managed to get internet
access on my laptop through tethering. There were two ways, as far
as I remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>TMNet dial-up using a mobile phone line</li>
<li>GPRS tethering</li>
</ul>
<p>Both worked, but TMNet dial-up using the mobile line was faster than
GPRS. So I used my parents&rsquo; mobile phone for this. The result?
Their mobile bill skyrocketed.</p>
<p>When I was in university, I became heavily influenced by the internet,
especially the concepts of server-client architecture and MMO
(massively multiplayer online) systems. I was deeply into the
<a href="https://forum.ragezone.com/">Ragezone</a> forum. That&rsquo;s where I learned a lot
about networking and tried to understand how distributed or client-server systems
actually work. Everything was unofficial, there was no formal course
like in class. Servers went down, got hacked, social scams, I&rsquo;ve
experienced all of it. These are some of the servers I built:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forsaken World</li>
<li>Jade Dynasty</li>
<li>Perfect World</li>
<li>Risk Your Life (RYL)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, through trying to create game servers, I learned more about
software in general, how it works, and this was further strengthened by
the theory I learned in class.</p>
<p>All the MMO games I built had to be promoted using websites. This was when I
used a lot of PHP, MySQL, and jQuery.</p>
<p>Up until now, I&rsquo;m still learning. Technology moves fast, so we have to learn
fast too. In the context of backend development, my journey went like this:</p>

<p>What I gained from this journey is a strong foundation. The fundamentals remain
the same and don&rsquo;t shake. Just like a house whose foundation is its pillars,
and just like Islam whose pillars are its core principles.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a vibe coder, an AI-assisted coder, or a &ldquo;real&rdquo; coder, the
fundamentals are still the same.</p>
