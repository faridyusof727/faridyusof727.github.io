In a bustling tech startup called KathTech Inc. _(not the real name)_,
our team was working on a highly anticipated app—one that was meant
to revolutionize the way people ordered bubble tea _(not a real app)_.
Each of us brought unique ideas to the table, but there was one person
who stood out: Adrian the Architect. Known for his brilliant mind,
Adrian had a reputation for coming up with ideal, flawless technical
solutions. The kind of solutions that made you go, “Wow, that’s
genius!” —until you realized they would take three years to build.

One day, we were assigned a task: users were clamoring for a simple
feature to customize their drinks—like choosing ice level and sugar
percentage. Adrian took it upon himself to brainstorm, and boy, did he
deliver.

“Guys,” Adrian began, with a dramatic pause, “we’re going to build a
machine-learning algorithm that predicts the perfect drink customization
for each user based on their past orders, current mood, and even weather
conditions. It’ll be powered by a custom-built AI model trained on
terabytes of data. Users won’t even have to think; the app will just know.”

The team was in awe. Adrian’s solution sounded incredible—like something
out of a sci-fi movie. But then I raised my hand.

“Adrian, I love your vision,” I started diplomatically, “but we’re dealing
with users who just want to pick their sugar level today. Training an AI
model? Building a recommendation engine? That’ll take months, if not
years. By the time we’re done, our users might have switched to making
their own bubble tea at home!”

The room fell silent. I could tell Adrian was a bit deflated. “So, what do
you suggest, then?” he asked, arms crossed.

“Well,” I said, “why don’t we start simple? Let’s create a basic feature
where users can manually select their ice level and sugar percentage. It
doesn’t need AI or machine learning—just a few dropdown menus. It’ll
deliver value immediately, and users will appreciate having the option.
Once it’s up and running, we can collect feedback and, then, look into
fancier solutions like your AI model.”

In the world of software development, it’s easy to get lost in the allure
of ideal solutions—perfect, elegant, but often impractical in the short
term. Being a pragmatic programmer means focusing on delivering value
first, even if the solution is simple or imperfect. It’s about understanding
that progress is better than perfection, and that sometimes, a few
dropdown menus can pave the way for game-changing AI.

So, the next time someone proposes a solution that sounds more like a
PhD thesis than a quick win, remember: a bubble tea drinker just wants
their 50% sugar level today. The perfect AI can wait.
