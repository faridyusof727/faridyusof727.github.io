Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Farid, proudly living in ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾.

> Currently, I'm a Software Engineer at [Xsolla](https://xsolla.com).

I'm a passionate, innovative, and results-driven leader and software engineer who
believes in continuous learning. An excellent communicator with strong
interpersonal skills to lead large teams across functions to achieve set targets.

I'm also a die-hard-fan of Go. So, most of my posts are about Go.

If you need to contact me, you can find me on

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faridyusof727/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/faridyusof727)
- [X/Twitter](https://x.com/faridyusof727)
- [Telegram](https://t.me/faridyusof727)

And if you need me to mentor you or your team, please connect with me on
[adplist.org](https://adplist.org/mentors/farid-yusof). Hey, don't worry, it'll be
casual and fun!

Just a heads up for head hunters, I'll be more excited to talk to you if the hiring
company includes Go in their tech stack. ðŸ˜„
